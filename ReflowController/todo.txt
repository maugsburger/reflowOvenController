important
- doubleclick to exit load profile screen doesn't work
- cycle display is not correct yet for vertical mode
- make any direct pin access code portable
- fix bounds limits on settings (fan at -300%? lol)
- Show which profile is loaded, and load selected profile by default

low priority
- fix text leaving crap behind when redrawn, stale text after leaving menus
- be more descriptive on how to exit menus
- implement action selection on spare D5 and maybe D10 pin
    example: when to perform: after soak, after ramp up, etc:
             what to perform: go high, go low, pulse/hold for X seconds, etc
             data to perform: time to hold, delay to go high/low, etc
- reduce size to fit on a micro again
- Log (and show) completed and canceled run count

optional
- look into adding scrollbar, and maybe a scroll area border
- show stats/graph/divergence/something of previous run in lower area OR extend menus to fit LCD
- add temperature calibration / offset (is this necessary?)
- wonder why I am fighting with such a small platform and limitations of arduino for this
